    <h2>CENTRAL IBRARY</h2>
    <img src="d.jpeg" alt="library" >
    <p>A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology."[1] A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering."[2] School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school."[3]

<h2>COMPUTER LAB</h2>

<p>
Well-designed and separate computer labs for kids and older children, run by a well-educated and qualified faculty, with one-on-one access, which means there is one computer for each child. Pre – primary kids learn words through PowerPoint presentations and innovative software.

We have invested in new ERP software which would further raise teaching-learning-working at Udgam to contemporary technological standards.

There are 200 computers in our labs currently. They are state-of-the-art with multimedia, most of them with 17″ LCD monitors that are easier on eyes, generate less heat and consume less power thereby keeping the classroom atmosphere comfortable for children. We use our own LAN with Windows XP for teaching-learning, documentation and presentations. Currently we can claim 1:10 as the ‘student to computer ratio’ on campus.

<h2>SCIENCE LAB</h2>
